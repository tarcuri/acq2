Changes from AprQ2 v1.211

- Nearly all dynamic light colors and sizes have been adjusted.

- Added dynamic light at rail trail end position.

- Added dynamic light at bullet mark position.

- Added dynamic light to grenades.

- Changed rocket trail color.

- Force all explosions to use alpha blending.

- Force 24 bit color for SDL refresh.

- Request stencil buffer for SDL refresh (fixes gl_shadows 2).

- Enable key repeat for SDL refresh.

- Clamp GL_LightPoint values, enforcing minimum brightness for ents.**

- Change quite a few cvar value defaults.

- Fix gl_scale glitch when starting up the refresh.

- Decrease cl_blend intensity.

- Use sane build targets on GNU/Linux.

- Fix gamei386.so build on GNU/Linux.

- Default gl_texturemode to GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR (bilinear filtering).

- Fix Anisotropic filtering (use glTexParameterf instead of glTexParameterv).

- Use high-resolution console characters when gl_scale > 1.0.

- Update to R1Q2 protocol version 1905.

** While some might hastily call this a "cheat", I say it allows players to
use decent looking gl_modulate and intensity values while still seeing items
and other players.  People could just as easily set gl_modulate 10, but then
the whole game looks like ass.  For mods where having entities hiding in the
dark is critical, server admins can override the 'gl_minlight_entities' cvar.
