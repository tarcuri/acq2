AprQ2 installation is fairly straightforward.  Type 'make' to build the game.
Feel free to edit Makefile to meet your needs, but do so at your own peril.
By default, the binaries will be built to the 'releasei386' directory.  Copy
them to an appropriate path (e.g. ~/.quake2, /usr/share/games/quake2, etc).

There is also a small baseq2 directory included in this source tree.  It 
provides a few image files for things like bullet holes in walls.  To install
it, simply copy it to an appropriate path as above.
