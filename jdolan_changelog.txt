-cvar gl_decals_max to set maximum decals, this can use alot memory, so its limited between 256 - 4096.
-cvar gl_stainmaps needs vid_restart, it uses alot memory, so dont need to allocate it when not used.
-Doesnt load caustic, shell effect or decal images if those arent in use.
-Alot stuff from q2pro.

 was loaded before.
-Try to exec postinit.cfg at same place where old autoexec was loaded.
-Q3 dedicated console for windows.
